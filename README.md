# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The premise of this Udacity Project 4 was that the original developer of this application saw the value in testing, included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and started writing their first test suite however it is incomplete.

I have left the instructional code comments as a learning tool for myself in the future when I review this project and advance it as part of my personal portfolio. Please also note that I utilized sources both within Udacity and elsewhere, those links are in the code. I had difficulty understanding how to approach the asynchronous code. I studied what Lloan Alas instructed in his video walk-through and used his code (properly commented) as it made so much sense and I couldn't conceive of a way to improve it or even adapt it.

# How to Run this Application

1. git clone https://github.com/thisLinda/feedreader-project-submit

2. open index.html with the browser of your choice, to update the code for additional feeds enter code in app.js, save, refresh in the browser
