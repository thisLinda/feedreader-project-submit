# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The premise of this Udacity Project 4 was that the original developer of this application saw the value in testing, included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and started writing their first test suite however it is incomplete.

I have left the instructional code comments as a learning tool for myself in the future when I review this project and advance it as part of my personal portfolio. Please also note that I utilized sources both within Udacity and elsewhere, those links are in the code. I had difficulty understanding how to approach the asynchronous code. I studied what Lloan Alas instructed in his video walk-through and used his code (properly commented) as it made so much sense and I couldn't conceive of a way to improve it or even adapt it.

# How to Run this Application

21. Write a README file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application. If you have added additional tests (for Udacious Test Coverage), provide documentation for what these future features are and what the tests are checking for.

Table of Contents
Getting Started
Download or clone the repository.

git clone https://github.com/bloom305/FEND-FeedReader.git

Using Feed Reader
Open index.html with the browser of your choice.
Currently, the feed reader will populate with entries from four different feeds; Udacity Blog, CSS Tricks, HTML5 Rocks, and Linear Digressions.
To add your favorite feed to the mix, add another object into the allFeeds array in app.js.
Save any changes to the app.js file.
Refresh page in the browser.
Note: The object placed into allFeeds must have two properties, name and url. Make the name descriptive and the url a string of the link to RSS feed.

Testing
In Browser
Enter the directory of the repository, then open the index.html file with the code editor of your choice.
Uncomment lines 56 and 57, then save changes to the file.
Open index.html with the browser of your choice.
